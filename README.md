# temporalbandit_TDmodel

This repository contains modeling and analysis code for simulating and interpreting trial initiation behavior using a temporal-difference (TD) reinforcement learning framework. The model is applied to behavioral data from a temporal wagering task (Constantinople Lab) and evaluates how reward expectation and block context influence latent decision variables like response latency.

The code supports simulations and figure generation for model outputs and their comparison with dopamine recording (fiber photometry of an optical sensor, GRAB).
